                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                            Currently enrolled in "We Code It" C# Bootcamp. I will be finishing the program in mid December where I plan to find a job as Junior Program Developer.
                        I'm most interested in finding a company that has a strong mentorship program where I can excel and can use my experience to help the company grow.

                            Before deciding to enroll into a bootcamp, I was an Executive Chef in a corporate cafe. I've had the pleasure of leading 
                        a strong team for the past couple years, but felt it was time to move on from the culinary industry. I was always interested in 
                        the tech industry and after talking to a few friends who completed programming bootcamps, I felt compelled to enroll into a program myself.

                            Outside of coding, I live in Lakewood with my wife and dog. If I'm not a home I'm more than likely adventuring in a state park, or on a mountain bike enjoying the outdoors.
