                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                            In 2016 I moved to Cleveland ohio, along with moving to Cleveland was the desire to change my career path. While exploring new career paths, I
                        took a promotion as Executive Chef, which was a great opportunity. I had the pleasure of leading a strong team for a couple years, but again felt it was time 
                        to move on from the culinary industry. 
                        
                            I found myself wanting to get more involved into the tech industry. I felt it was an industry that I wanted to become part of, due to my belief 
                        that it is the future and interesting. After talking to several friends who successfully got jobs out of a Coding Bootcamp.
                        I decided to enroll in "We Code It" C# Bootcamp. I finished the program in mid December  2019. After completing the BootCamp I started to continue my education 
                        by taking Udemy courses furthering my understanding.
                           
                            Outside of my career I'm involved in the cycling community and use to race cyclocross. Although these days I just enjoy trying to get "Rad" on my mountain bike.
                        Exploring with my Wife and Dog is also something I enjoy doing when we have the time to do so together.
